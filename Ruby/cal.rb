##Building a calculator

puts "Enter a number: "
num1 = gets.chomp().to_i
puts "Enter another number: "
num2 = gets.chomp().to_i

puts (num1 + num2)
##note it just prints both numbers as opposed to adding them
##so you have to convert them to an i (integer) first!!
## f is float (decimals)
